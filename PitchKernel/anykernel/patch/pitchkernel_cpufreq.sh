# PitchKernel CPU & Scheduler Tuning Script
# Installed to /data/adb/post-fs-data.d/ by anykernel.sh at flash time.
# KSU/Magisk runs this automatically on every boot as root.
#
# CPU FREQUENCY NOTE:
# FKM and other tools show "Prime cluster max freq: 3187 MHz" — this is correct.
# cpuinfo_max_freq = what the SM8250 hardware OPP table reports as capable.
# With uclamp disabled, schedutil will NOT boost to 3187 MHz for normal tasks.
# The 3187 MHz entry is there in hardware but the governor won't reach it without
# an explicit uclamp boost request from a task. This is the intended behaviour.
#
# I/O SCHEDULER FIX:
# Android's init.qcom.rc resets the block device scheduler to cfq at boot.
# This script re-enforces mq-deadline on every boot AFTER init.rc runs,
# since post-fs-data.d runs after early init but has root access to sysfs.
#
# Gaming fix: reduce schedutil rate_limit_us for faster frequency response.
# Default = 500us — lags before responding to load burst, causes frame drops.
# 200us = faster response without burning power on idle.

# --- I/O Scheduler enforcement ---
# UFS on SM8250 appears as /dev/sda or /dev/sdf depending on firmware.
# Try all common block device names. mq-deadline is correct for UFS 3.1 NVMe-like queue.
